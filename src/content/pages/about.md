I'm on a mission to unlock human potential in the people I work with & through the experiences we create.

I lead the product team at <a href="https://tanzu.vmware.com/labs" target="_blank">VMware Pivotal Labs</a> in London and I am on the board of <a href="https://productmanagementfestival.com/zurich/" target="_blank">Product Management Festival Europe</a>. I'm also a speaker, facilitator, coach, investor and runner.

I’ve co-founded a few (failed) startups – <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/business/small-business/casual-gym-visit-app-an-australian-first-20130804-2r7h1.html" target="_blank">FitUsIn</a>, <a href="https://gust.com/companies/datamunch" target="_blank">DataMunch</a> and RippleCrowd. I’ve had the privilege of working with great companies and startups such as <a href="https://www.pwc.com.au/" target="_blank">PwC</a>, <a href="https://podio.com/" target="_blank">Podio</a> and <a href="https://www.freelancer.com/" target="_blank">Freelancer.com</a>. I was also the founding licensee for <a href="https://www.tedxmacquarieuni.com/" target="_blank">TEDxMacquarieUniversity</a>.
